The **Sound Editor** app is intended for users who wants to explore audio signals through visual sound analysis. Also this program can be used in the ip-telephony since it allows compress and decompress audio data to G.711 codec using two main companding algorithms, the *Âµ-law* algorithm and *A-law* algorithm. The app works only with .mp3 and .wav files.

Main features:
